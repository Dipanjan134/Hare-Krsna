<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Dear Friends! Kindly listen to these bhajans given below every day. This sound vibration of Krishna's Holy Name will purify your heart.  
श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णो: स्मरणं(SB 7.5.23), in Shri Mad Bhagwatam, Bhakt Prahlad has stated that श्रवणं(Hearing Hari Kirtan and Hari Katha) is one of the processes of devotional service(Bhakti), just by hearing and chanting it again and again, you will attain the highest destination, Krishna's Supreme abode(Golok Dham). Whenever we hear  Krishna's name, it reminds us of him, as Krishna says "मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो"- Always think of Me, become My devotee(Gita Ch18.65) </p>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> You were not given this 
<br> 1) Tongue for talking gossip of others and having food prohibited by the scriptures, but it is given to utter the name of Hari and eat Hari Prasadam
<br> 2) Ears for hearing gossip, but it is for listening to Kirtan and Hari Katha
<br> 3) Eyes for ogling the opposite gender, but it is for reading Sacred texts like Bhagavad Gita and beholding the beauty of temples and deities
 
<br> And if you keep concentrating your senses on these materialistic things, then it means you are misusing your senses, thus be ready to become deaf, dumb, and blind! 
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> You must have heard that some people are blind by birth, but do you know why he is blind, Why God didn't give him eyes like others? , you may say that he is
बेचारा and feel sad for him, but in actuality, he is NOT बेचारा, he is suffering only because of his past deeds. Shastras say-"अवश्यमेव भोक्तव्यं कृतं कर्म शुभाशुभम्। ना भुक्तं क्षीयते कर्म कल्पकोटि शतैरपि" That, Every person has to suffer the consequences of his good or bad deeds. Karma is never destroyed without being suffered, even if millions of years pass by. The person is blind because he has misused his eyes in his previous births, and as a result, he is blind today. And now if you also misuse your senses, then you also have to suffer either in this birth or in the next birth. And No one can save you.<br> So don't misuse your senses! Engage the senses in the service of Lord Krishna as Only Krishna can free you from the reactions of your deeds.</p>
