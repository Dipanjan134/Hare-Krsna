<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> Self Realisation</h1>
</div>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> Hare Krishna My Dear!<br>Self Realisation is understanding our true identity as eternal spiritual beings, distinct from the temporary material body. By delving deep into spirituality, we can awaken our dormant love for Krishna. This loving relation is the key to eternal happiness and fulfillment</p>

<h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;"> Who Am I? is the the 1st question of Self Realisation</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> It is clear that all the living entities including Humans, Dogs, Cats, Elephants, Lions, Ants, and even the demi-gods are part and parcel of Lord Krishna. Our real identity is that we are SERVANTS. Servant means "One Who Provides Services". No one is a master in this world. And it is the nature of all entities to Serve someone whether it may be the society, nation, family, etc. Now think carefully. In a family, usually, the oldest(Father) takes care of the family members and his instructions are followed by the members. Thus he controls the family and is known as the Head(Supreme) Of the family, but does it mean that he is the master of the family members? No, he is not. He is controlled by his son. The son may be stubborn and resolute to get something, and the father is sometimes forced to fulfill the demands of his son.<br>
Therefore, in a family the family members are controlled by the father and the father himself provides service to the members, thus he is also a servant. He is the servant of Family.</p>
 

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align: center;"> Similarly, The Prime Minister Of A Country is known as the Head of The Country as it is the Supreme Post, but it doesn't mean that he is a master as he is also rendering service to the people, thus he is a servant of people.<br> Therefore, we concluded that None of us is Master, every living being had to render service to someone else.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> Now, here comes the main thing. To whom we are rendering service will determine whose servants we are. Every one of us is a spirit soul, not this body which is changed several times. And since we all are part and parcel of Krishna. So it becomes our foremost duty to serve Krishna. The only thing you have to do is perform all kinds of activities only for the pleasure of Krishna, not for our sense of gratification. Sense gratification is the main cause of bondage in this material world. It is very easy to say this. But how to do it practically? Do we have to renounce all our material obligations and relations and become Sanyasi? NO. Let us understand it with a simple example.

<br> Suppose when a person is cooking, instead of cooking for the pleasure of family members, the person can think "Yes, let me cook for the pleasure of Krishna". Here, the cooking activity is taking place and after offering it to Krishna, the family members are going to get the prasadam and will be more satisfied. Thus the cooking activity is the same whether he is cooking for the family or Krishna, he will be cooking. But simply by thinking that he is cooking for Krishna, and offering it 1st to him, the person will be liberated. This is Krishna Consciousness. <br>

<h1 style="font-size:35px; text-align:center;"> What is Krishna Consciousness and How it is different from Material Consciousness</h1>


<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> The philosophy of Krsna Consciousness doesn't ask anyone to give up his material duties and relations, but it is simply the change in consciousness that you are not doing it for self-pleasure but for Krishna. Like in the above example, the Krsna Conscious person is not renouncing his work of cooking or his family members, he is just changing his mindset(intention of cooking) also cooking for Krsna doesn't mean that the family is not going to get that food, they will get the prasad. That's the difference between Krishna Conscious and Material Conscious person. Both are doing the same work of cooking and both of their families will get the food but the Krishna-conscious person is cooking it for Krishna and offering him 1st while a materialistic person is cooking only for his pleasure. <br> I know that you will object to me by saying that it is not possible to offer food every time to Krishna. Ok, I can understand that. If you can't offer your food to Krishna at 1st then just Simply Chant The Hare Krishna Mahamantra which goes like this - "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare" while cooking. This is enough to make the food prasad. Also, you can play the Kirtan Of Harinam and listen to it when you are cooking .</p>


<h1 style="font-size:35px; text-align:center;"> Conclusion </h1>


<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> Therefore, do all your activities thinking that you are doing it for Krishna. Do your academic studies by thinking that after studying this, you will get a job and earn money which you will use in the service of Krishna, like sometimes donating to the construction of Krsna temple, telling others about Krsna Consciousness, etc.<br>I think that you must have understood what Krishna Consciousness is. This realization that you have to do all your activities for Krishna's pleasure since you are his servant is known as Self-Realisation.</p>
