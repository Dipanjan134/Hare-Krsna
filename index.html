<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> IMPORTANCE OF ASSOCIATION OF A DEVOTEE</h1>
<p style="font-size:40px;"> My Dear Friends, Here I am going to mention the MOST IMP THING to get Krsna's mercy</p>

<img style="width: 45%;" src="sadhu sanga4.jpg">
<img style="width: 45%;" src="Devotee association.jpg">

<p style="font-size:25px;"> It is completely IMPOSSIBLE to get the mercy of the Lord without the mercy of a devotee. One must associate with the devotees to get the platform of devotional service. Even if you associate for a single moment, then you will attain all kinds of success. Also, in history, no one has become a devotee without associating with a Pure Devotee. So, one must render services to the devotees who are regularly engaged in Krsna's service </p>


<img style="width: 45%;" src="sadhu sanga2.jpg">

<img style="width: 45%;" src="sadhu sanga1.jpg">
<p style="font-size:25px;"> The Association of a devotee is so auspicious that it can't be compared to being transferred to heaven also. It is because Krsna sends his messenger(devotee) to a person whom he wants to approach him. So, if a person is in association with a devotee then it means that Krsna wants to take that person to his Supreme Abode Golok Dham which is permanent and after attaining that, no one returns to this Sad Material World.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:50px;">DON'T BE TOO CLOSE WITH THE NON-DEVOTEES </h1>
<img style="width: 45%;" src="sadhu sanga5.jpg">
<img style="width: 45%;" src="sadhu sanga6.jpg">

<p style="font-size:25px;"> It is the STRICT INSTRUCTION of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu(Incarnation Of Radha & Krsna) that a person who wants spiritual advancement SHOULD NOT ASSOCIATE WITH NON-DEVOTEES of Krsna. Even if you associate with the Non-Devotees, don't share your hearty feelings with them since they may deviate you from the path of Krsna Consciousness. However, while associating with non-devotees, it is important to maintain a respectful and compassionate attitude. By seeing all living beings as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, we can develop a sense of empathy towards all. 


<h1 style="font-size:50px;">Never disrespect a devotee of Krsna</h1>

<img style="width: 45%;" src="Bhakt Offense.jpg">
<img style="width: 45%;" src="sadhu offense.jpg">



<p style="font-size:25px;"> It is a great offense if a person disrespects a devotee. Krsna may forgive that person who disrespects him but he will never forgive anyone who disrespects his devotee. Anyone who commits such actions is thrown to hell. A devotee can protect a sinful person from Krsna. E.g. Haridas Thakur saved the servants of the Mughal King who had beaten him severely, from Krsna. This is the mercy of a devotee, from this incident, it can be concluded that "The Pure Devotees are more merciful than Krsna himself" 
<div style= "text-align:center;">
<img style="width: 45%;" src="sadhu sanga7.jpg"></div>

<p style="font-size:25px;">  Bhakti of Krsna can't be attained by doing pious activities(Punya karm), by keeping Vrat(Fasting),by opening schools & hospitals or by donating in charity(Dan). One can understand Krsna ONLY by the grace of a devotee. So, to get the mercy of Krsna, one must approach a Pure Devotee. There is NO  ALTERNATE WAY!!

<h1 style="font-size:50px;">Starting Point Of Distress and Darkness In One's Life</h1>

<div style= "text-align:center;">
<img style="width: 45%;" src="distress.jpg"></div>
 <p style="font-size:25px;">The phase of darkness and distress starts in one's life when one is separated from the devotee of Krsna. The association of a devotee is VERY RARE! So, you should try your best to get the Devotee Association. Do listen to the words of His Divine Grace Gopal Krishna Maharaj

<h3 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;"> Shri Gopal Krishna Maharaj</h3>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> Why I made this website?</h1>

<p style="font-size:25px;"> My dear friends, you might wonder why I created the pdfs(Why Harinam, Ultimate Solution of all problems, etc), And why I created this web page. <br> If you want to know the answer then watch the video given below</p>

<div style= "text-align:center;">
<video src="Why Preach.mp4" controls />
</div>


 <p style="font-size:25px;"> So, now you may have understood. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu(Incarnation of Radha & Krsna) wanted to spread Krsna Consciousness all over the world. So it becomes the foremost duty of a Vaishnava(Krsna's Devotee) to preach Krsna Consciousness. Though a fallen soul like me can't preach all over the globe. But I will try to contribute my best to the Movement of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu(Mission Hare Krishna).

<p style="font-size:25px;">Also, Krsna says in the Bhagavad Gita (Ch18.68 and 18.69) "The one who preaches The Bhagavad Gita, attains him without fail. And NO ONE is dear to him more than the one who preaches the Gita.</p>

 <p style="font-size:25px;"> My Dear, I have only two requests for you. Please do this, and I am sure that you will Attain Krishna.<br> 1)Please please!! START READING THE BHAGAVAD GITA AND FOLLOW IT STRICTLY.<br>2)CHANT THE HARE KRSNA MAHAMANTRA AT LEAST FOR 10-15 mins every day.!!</p>
